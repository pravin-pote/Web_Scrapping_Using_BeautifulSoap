# Inspirational Quotes Scraper

This is a Python script that gets inspirational quotes from a website called passiton.com.
It uses requests to download the page and BeautifulSoup to pick out the quotes and their authors from the HTML code.

How it works:
1. The script sends a request to the website and gets the page content.
2. It looks for the part of the page that has all the quotes.
3. It goes through each quote block and grabs the quote text and the author.
4. It prints the quotes and authors on the screen.

I wrote this project to learn how to do web scraping in Python using BeautifulSoup, which is a helpful library for parsing HTML pages. You can run the script to see inspirational quotes printed in your terminal.

To run this:
- Make sure you have Python3 installed.
- Install the needed libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, and html5lib.(also added the way to install them)
- Run the script file.

This is a good starting for learning Web scrapping if you want to learn about web scraping!
